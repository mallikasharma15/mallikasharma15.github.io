  <!-- Intro section -->
  <p>
    My research explores the intersection of energy economics, electricity markets, and environmental policy. 
    I focus on how infrastructure and policy design can accelerate sustainable energy transitions, 
    particularly in the context of electric vehicles and renewable integration.
